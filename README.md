## Technologies Used
- **HTML:** The fundamental structure of the website is crafted using well-organized and semantic HTML.

- **BEM (Block Element Modifier):** CSS classes are structured according to the BEM methodology to enhance maintainability and minimize style conflicts, using the Block__Element--Modifier format.

- **SCSS (Sassy CSS):** Improves code maintainability and readability through features such as:

    - **Mixins:** Reusable code fragments to adhere to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.
    - **Variables:** Consistent values stored in variables for easy global changes.
    - **Nesting:** Nested selectors for better visual management of complex layouts.
    - **CSS Rules:** Extensive rules encompassing layout, typography, colors, and more.
    - **Adaptive Layout:** Responsive design implemented with media queries to ensure optimal - viewing across all devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).

    - **Style Reset:** A basic CSS reset to standardize default browser styles, providing a consistent starting point.

- **JavaScript (Minimal Usage):** Light JavaScript usage for minor interactive elements or functionalities (e.g., burger menu).

Additionally, the project includes the creation and implementation of:

- **Custom Product Slider:** A personalized slider for showcasing products.
- **Product Card:** Detailed product cards displaying essential information.
